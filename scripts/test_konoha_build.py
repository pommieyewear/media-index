"""Checks that the TMDB matching ported into konoha_build.py still agrees with TmdbClient.kt.

Every case here is one the Kotlin names in a comment as having actually gone wrong. The two
implementations decide the same thing for the same title, and when they drift a viewer sees another
show's episodes illustrating this one — which is why the port is tested at all rather than trusted.

Plain asserts and no pytest: this runs in the same bare venv the release scripts use, and adding a
test dependency to publish an APK is not a trade worth making.
