"""Build the anime metadata dataset the app reads in place of AlokRepo/Konoha.

Konoha was a third-party static mirror of AniList + TMDB served over jsDelivr. It stopped: its
`sync-status.json` still reads `lastFinishedYear: 2010`, `stats.json` was last written 2026-06-08
and `airing.json` was last checked 2026-05-19. Anything that aired since is thin or absent, which
is why `TmdbClient` exists at all — it fills the gaps Konoha left, one live request at a time, for
every viewer.

This rebuilds the same tree from the primary sources so the gaps stop being gaps. The output layout
is byte-for-byte the shape `KonohaClient` already parses, so pointing the app at it is a base-URL
change and nothing else.

The TMDB half is a deliberate port of `TmdbClient.kt`, not a fresh implementation. That file
encodes matching rules that were learned from real failures — an exact episode count binds harder
than a matching year, a season marker has to come off the title before searching, and the bundled
id-map's own `confidence` cannot be believed (it rates Dandadan a HIGH match for a 2024 Chinese
drama). Re-deriving those here would mean re-learning them. Where the two must agree, the Kotlin is
the source of truth and this follows it; see `pick_season`, `pick_group` and `titles_match`.

Stages are separate commands because they fail differently and the expensive one must be resumable:

    catalog     Walk AniList for every anime. ~20,800 titles, ~25 min (AniList is the slow one).
    episodes    Ask TMDB for episode lists. ~15,000 titles, ~20 min at 8 workers. Resumable.
    emit        Write the publishable tree from what the first two cached.
    schedule    Write per-month airing times for the calendar. 2 requests a month, seconds.
    assets      Copy the bundled files into app/src/main/assets/.

A daily refresh is `catalog` + `episodes --airing-only` + `emit` + `schedule`, which only touches
titles that can still change.

Usage:
    scripts/.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/konoha_build.py catalog
    scripts/.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/konoha_build.py episodes --airing-only
    scripts/.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/konoha_build.py emit --out build/konoha/data

#   a month shard         ~12KB gzipped, 462 rows
